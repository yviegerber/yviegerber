When I think of time, I think of a three dimensional ever changing fabric. I think of a river that flows as one body, stitched by its own entangled dance with matter. The past will forever exist as does the future, held by the bed of the river. I think of how time changes paces depending on location, like a current, and how it bends and
warps like water. And how a moment in time is ephemeral, a collision that ends, but whose particles never perish. Where does the past live???? It doesn’t live in the house it once did, the family moved away. The daughter is now a mother, she has a daughter and a home of her own. The particles of time are never dying, only leaving the homes they’ve outgrown.

    <p>
There are patterns like whirlpools in personal and collective timelines, repetitions and circles where history repeats making the landscape of time an upward spiral with a constant radius.     
</p>

    <p>
Time moves in spirals and it’s making me dizzy to return to the same place from a distance, so aware of the void between,
Is this what it means to grow up, to experience every place at a distance from what it used to be?
