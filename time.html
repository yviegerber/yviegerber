    <p> style="font-style: italic;">
      When I think of time, I think of a three dimensional ever changing fabric. I think of a river that flows as one body, stitched by its own entangled dance with matter. The past will forever exist as does the future, held by the bed of the river. I think of how time changes paces depending on location, like a current, and how it bends and
warps like water. And how a moment in time is ephemeral, a collision that ends, but whose particles never perish. Where does the past live???? It doesn’t live in the house it once did, the family moved away. The daughter is now a mother, she has a daughter and a home of her own. The particles of time are never dying, only leaving the homes they’ve outgrown.

    <!-- Full-width content continues normally -->
    <p> style="font-style: italic;">
      Things don’t stand in objectivity, they stand in relativity and maybe time is a terrain with its own three dimensions. We were walking and met in a valley; and the scenery changed so now I am at sea level and you are 5,000 feet up. When we meet on the street at 4:00pm, we are still separated by our own spatial dimensions of time.

    <p>
      And then there are patterns in personal and collective timelines, repetitions and circles where history repeats making the landscape of time an upward spiral with a constant radius. Like whirlpools…
    </p>

    <p> style="font-style: italic;">
    Time moves in spirals and it’s making me dizzy to return to the same place from a distance, so aware of the void between,
    Is this what is means to grow up, to experience every place at a distance from what it used to be?
