        <p>
i left my town for the city of angels 
the night before i flew, i wrote my letters and packed my bags <br>
it was the most free i’d ever felt <br>
then i was a girl <br>
in a land of dreams with the climate of Mars and disposition of Neptune, just like me <br>
i tend to become my environment <br>
so i became myself <br>
i traipsed through the landscape of my mind <br>
skinny dipping in my subconscious and playing orchestras of illusions 
    
    </p>

        <p>
don’t miss me baby, but do think of me <br>
you know i’ll still love you
  </p>

        <p>
i’d meet my girls at the candy store downtown <br>
and we’d buy handfuls of caramels and sit on the curb and watch them melt in our palms <br>
our laughs would float as balloons above us <br>
while we stared into the syrupy reflections <br>
reading our fortune and fame 
</p>

        <p>
don’t miss me baby, but do think of me <br>
you know I’ll still love you
  </p>

        <p>
i walked through town to the end of the pier <br>
waiting for my boyfriend to reappear <br>
summer heat <br>
ruby tears dripping down rosy cheeks <br>
splashing in the sea <br>
i waited to be his puppet <br>
so very patiently 
</p>

        <p>
don’t miss me baby, but do think of me <br>
you know I’ll still love you
  </p>

        <p>
i knew a girl and she too was just like me <br>
she was an angel like the city that raised her  <br>
with dark eyes and red lips <br>
she and i would sit in the velvet night, <br>
two figures of smoke attached at the seams <br>
sitting on steps smoking poetic dreams <br>
sidewalk psychoanalysts, we’d offer our thoughts for free <br>
observing the many faces of reality  <br>
we kissed goodbye on a new moon <br>
then disappeared separately <br>
i cried as i drove in the hills <br>
through the velvet night <br>
as i remembered that God always said,  <br>
a circle ends only to begin again 
</p>

        <p>
don’t miss me baby, but do think of me <br>
you know I’ll still love you
